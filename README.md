Do the way we evaluate Medicare hospitals have an effect on the way Patients perceived quality of care?
Medicare captures Patient Survey results and reports the by Hospital yearly since 2014. 

Medicare publishes annual reports on metrics as well as survey results by hospital. I will be combining separate reports of quality metrics that rate their ER time and effective care, infection rates, ownership type, inpatient psych care, average spend per patient, and outpatient imaging services per hospital.


The data for these metrics will be taken from annual reports from https://data.medicare.gov/ for the past 4 years.

This data will be used to predict what Patient will rate the "Summary star rating" on their Hospital Survey.
