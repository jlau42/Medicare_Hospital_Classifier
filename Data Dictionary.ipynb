    "- ### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Description The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure evaluates solo\n",
    "practitioners and\n",
    "groups of practitioners (including physicians) on their efficiency and is\n",
    "specialty-adjusted to\n",
    "account for the group’s specialty mix. Solo practitioners and groups of\n",
    "practitioners (including\n",
    "physicians) are identified by their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n",
    "Specifically, the\n",
    "MSPB Measure assesses the cost to Medicare of services performed by TINs\n",
    "during an MSPB\n",
    "episode, which comprises the period immediately prior to, \n",
    "during, and following\n",
    "a patient’s\n",
    "hospital stay\n",
    "- ### Numerator\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator for a TIN s specialty-adjusted MSPB Measure is the TIN s\n",
    "average MSPB Amount, which is defined as the sum of standardized, riskadjusted\n",
    "spending across all of a TIN s eligible episodes divided by the\n",
    "number of episodes for that TIN. This ratio is multiplied by the national average\n",
    "standardized episode cost. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and\n",
    "Part B claims with a start date falling between 3 days prior to an Inpatient\n",
    "Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospital admission (also known as the\n",
    "index admission for the episode) through 30 days post-hospital discharge.\n",
    "- ### Denominator\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator for a TIN s MSPB Measure is the specialty-adjusted MSPB\n",
    "expected cost based on the national specialty-specific expected cost of the\n",
    "specialties represented by the TIN s eligible professionals (EPs). Methodology\n",
    "for specialty-adjustment is discussed in the Specialty adjustment sectionbelow. Beneficiary populations eligible to be included in the MSPB Measure\n",
    "are made up of beneficiaries who were enrolled in both Medicare Parts A and\n",
    "B for the period 93 days prior to IPPS hospital admission until 30 days after\n",
    "discharge from a short-term acute care hospital stay, where the stay occurs\n",
    "during the period of performance. Defining the population in this manner\n",
    "ensures that each beneficiary s claims record contains sufficient fee-for-service\n",
    "(FFS) data both for measuring spending levels and for risk adjustment\n",
    "purposes. Only claims for beneficiaries admitted to subsection (d) hospitals\n",
    "during the period of performance are included in the calculation of the MSPB\n",
    "Measure. Subsection (d) hospitals are hospitals in the 50 States and D.C.\n",
    "other than: psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, hospitals whose\n",
    "inpatients are predominantly under 18 years old, hospitals whose average\n",
    "inpatient length of stay exceeds 25 days, and hospitals involved extensively in\n",
    "treatment for or research on cancer. The claims for inpatient admissions to\n",
    "subsection (d) hospitals are grouped into stays by beneficiary, admission date,\n",
    "and provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Denominator Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Beneficiary populations excluded from the MSPB calculation are those with\n",
    "episodes where\n",
    "at any time 93 days before admission through 30 days post-discharge, the\n",
    "beneficiary is enrolled\n",
    "in a Medicare Advantage plan, or Medicare is the secondary payer. Episodes\n",
    "where the\n",
    "beneficiary becomes deceased during the episode are also excluded.\n",
    "Regarding beneficiaries\n",
    "whose primary insurance becomes Medicaid during an episode due to\n",
    "exhaustion of Medicare\n",
    "Part A benefits, Medicaid payments made for services rendered to these\n",
    "beneficiaries are\n",
    "excluded, however, all Medicare Part A payments made before benefits are\n",
    "exhausted and all\n",
    "Medicare Part B payments made during the episode are included.\n",
    "Further, any episode in which the index admission inpatient claim has a 0\n",
    "actual payment or a 0 standardized payment is excluded. In addition, acute-to-acute transfers\n",
    "(where a transfer\n",
    "is defined based on the claim discharge code) are not considered index\n",
    "admissions. In other words, these cases do not generate new MSPB episodes, neither the hospital\n",
    "which transfers a\n",
    "patient to another subsection (d) hospital, nor the receiving subsection (d)\n",
    "hospital will have an\n",
    "index admission or associated MSPB episode attributed to them.\n",
    "Admissions to hospitals that Medicare does not reimburse through the IPPS\n",
    "system (e.g.,\n",
    "cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, hospitals in Maryland) are not\n",
    "considered index\n",
    "admissions and are therefore not eligible to begin an MSPB episode. If an\n",
    "acute-to-acute\n",
    "hospital transfer or a hospitalization in a PPS-exempt hospital happens during\n",
    "the 30-days\n",
    "following discharge from an index admission, however, these post-discharge\n",
    "costs will count\n",
